## Welcome to My Site

This is my first blog post using a simple, no-framework approach to building a personal website.

## Why Simple?

Sometimes you need a bicycle, not a jumbo jet. This setup gives me:

- **Fast loading** - no JavaScript frameworks
- **Easy to maintain** - I understand every line
- **Portable** - copy files anywhere
- **Version controlled** - full history in git

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing notes on building better software, lessons learned, and my development process.

Stay tuned for more posts!
