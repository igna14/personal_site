            <h1>about</h1>
            <p>I’ve always believed the world is made better through creators. Artists, entrepreneurs. People bold enough to take a step forward and create something out of nothing. Or something new out of many old things. 

                Building can be a hard and daunting task. I want to make it easier to start, and help folks do it Better (for themselves and people around them) when they’re on their way. 
                
                If you’re trying to build, or want to do it better - reach out, I’m around. </p>
